## Design Decisions
### Colours
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/colour-scheme.png">
The colour scheme employed in the project arose from searching for "Rose" Hexademical colour in the following
website, and using some of the complimentary colour scheme panel.

[Canva Complimentary Colours](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-meanings/rose/)

The colours used throughout the website are (and their Hexadecimal code):
+ Dark Pink #75003A
+ Medium Pink #FF007F
+ Light Pink #FF8AC4
+ Dark Green #00705D
+ Medium Green #008873
+ Dark Grey (body text) #3a3a3a

### Images
All image content for the project was sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). The logo came from the ICONPACKS website [Link](https://www.iconpacks.net/free-icon/flower-1537.html)

### Fonts
Just one font was used throughout the website, with varying weight for headings and body text.

# Features

### Common Elements
In terms of general structure throughout the website, the common elements across all 4 pages are the Header and Footer sections
+ The Header - This section will appear at the top of all pages and contains a Logo which stacks to the left, and the navigation menu which is positioned on the right. Both logo and menu will respond accordingly to differing screen sizes. The navigation menu will display which page is currently selected on the site, giving the user good feedback as to their whereabouts.
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/header.png">

+ The Footer - This section appears on the bottom of all pages and will contain some copyright information and a date specifying how recently the site has been updated, again giving the user good feedback that this site is actively maintained.
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/footer.png">

+ Banner Image - This section replaces the hero image on the homepage and therefore appears on just 3 pages. It will give the usual an extra visual clue of the page content and will appear just below the main page text heading of each page.
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/banner.png">

### Home Page
This is the landing page of the site which is what the user first sees on loading, and therefore needs to be visually appealing to gain the users attention. This page is comprised of the following elements:
+ Hero Image - This section spans the full page width and will have relevant image content to give the user a nice first impression of the restaurant. It will have a minimally invasive animation added to attract more attention. Some informative text will be overlayed.
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/hero.png">

+ Welcome Text - This section lies underneath the hero image and will be a short description of the restaurant.
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/welcome.png">

+ Call-to-action Boxes - This is the third and final section of content that is unique to the homepage. A trio of boxes with related image content and a suitable link to each section of the site (About Us, Menu, Contact Us). This will enhance the user experience by showing them clearly what other content areas are available on the website, and giving them another option to browse rather than just using the main navigation menu.
<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/call-to-action.png">

### About Us Page
This is the second page of the website and serves as a description of the owners and history of the restaurant. 2 medium sized images showing the owner and the premises will be placed alongside the relevant description text. This gives the user a good feel for what the business is all about by showing the point of contact (the owner), and displaying the person(s) behind the company.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/about-us.png">

### Menu Page
This page will display a typical daily menu of food on offer at the restaurant. It is important to be visually pleasing and readable by the user, and comprehensive in its display of food choices. The sections will be divided under the following headings:
+ Breakfast
+ Lunch
+ Dinner
+ Desserts

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/menu-screenshot.png">

### Contact Us Page
This page clearly displays the contact details of the restaurant and also a contact form should the user wish to submit any queries in that manner. Also included on this page will be a map showing the directions to the restaurant.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/contact.png">

### Thank You Page
This page appears only after the user has submitted a request using the contact form, and gives the user good visual feedback that the form has submitted. A link is present to enable the user to navigate back to the home page.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/thankyou.png">

### 404 Error Page
This page is used to catch any errors caused by the user entering a URL that does not exist on the website.

# Testing

## Cross-Browser Testing
I have tested this website across the 3 main web browsers used today, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge & Mozilla Firefox. The site loaded consistently across all 3 and no discrepancies were detected.

## Compatibility Testing
I tested the site across differing devices, such as the Nokia 4.2 smartphone with Android 11, Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop with different browsers on Windows 11, and on a Dell Studio laptop with different browsers on a Linux Mint operating system. No issues were reported between these devices.

## Responsiveness Testing
During development of this application, I regularly tested the responsiveness of the site using Google Chromes Developer tools. In my CSS media query rules, I used 4 separate break points to design the site for different screen sizes.

+ 800px width and below (medium screen size)
+ 600px width and below (small screen size)
+ 400px width and below (ultra small screen size)*

*Originally I had intended to use just the first 2 screen size breakpoints, however the main menu was not appearing as required using the 600px breakpoint so I added a smaller 400px rule.

### The Header
The header of the site, comprising of logo and navigation bar, spans the full width of the page on higher screen sizes above 800px, however once the viewport reduces to below this width, the menu stacks underneath the logo, with the necessary padding and margins adjusted so it looks well on even smaller viewports below 600 and 400px widths.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/header-smaller.png">

### The Footer
The footer of the website is a very simple feature with a text paragraph only and this responds well to various screen sizes, the text simply moving onto multiple lines on the smaller viewports.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/footer-smaller.png">

### Banner Image
The banner images which appear on all pages except for the homepage, resize naturally on different screen sizes due to a width of 100% being applied to the image. However, I felt that on smaller screen sizes this squashed the image too much, and made it far too small to view. Thus, on the smaller viewports I made sure this banner image had a minimum height and also had the "object fit" property so that it scaled without any skewing or distortion of the original image.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/banner-smaller.png">

### Hero Image
The hero image on the homepage resizes automatically for smaller viewports, the caption text and padding that is overlayed also resizes due to reduced font size and padding.

<img src="https://github.com/kevinjohnkiely/la-rosa-restaurant-project-1/blob/main/wireframesScreenshots/hero-smaller.png">

### Homepage Content - Intro Text & Call To Action Panels
The introductory text section of homepage (image below, left) scales nicely to smaller screen widths as it is just centered text with paddings and margins adjusted accordingly. The Call To Action section of the homepage (image below, right) orginates as a panel with 3 columns showing images and links, but on less than 800px screen widths, this changes to a single column with all 3 boxes stacked vertically.
