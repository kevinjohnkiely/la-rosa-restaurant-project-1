# La Rosa Restaurant - Project 1

<! -- Final screenshot goes here -->

This is the website of La Rosa restaurant, a newly opened restaurant in County Limerick, IRELAND. The website will serve as a vital online hub for new and returning customers to gain information about the new restaurant, and for local customers to consider it as a prominent option for eating out.

The main aim of this project is to construct an aesthetic, easily-navigable, responsive and modern website which greatly helps the marketing potential of the newly openend restaurant. It will be constructed using HTML & CSS web coding methods.
