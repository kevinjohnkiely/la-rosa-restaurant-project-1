                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p class="para-1">LaRosa Restaurant was established recently by husband and wife team Jay and May Lee.
                        Originally from Hong Kong, the Lees moved to the Limerick region 10 years ago where
                        they worked in various restaurants over the years. Last January they decided to take
                        the plunge and set up their own restaurant in the new post-pandemic hospitality industry
                        which is bouncing back so vibrantly after a difficult couple of years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para-1">May is the front-of-house contact and the public face of LaRosa, Jay is beavering away
                        in the background, using his extensive culinary skills to cook up a storm! Say hello to
                        May or Jay if you pop in!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="para-2">LaRosa Restaurant has risen like a phoenix from the ashes from a dilapadated former building
                        on main street, Adare, County Limerick. The old police barracks had lain idle for decades
                        until Jay & May decided to breathe new life into the main street by thoroughly renovating
                        the premises. Once an eyesore for the passing tourist trade, the building now stands proudly
                        amongst its neighbouring pubs and shops.
